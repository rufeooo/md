>block no space

mid <block sentence

```C
int main()
{
  return 0;
}
```

``` one-line code block ```

this is text with a `single tick` example

> blocks may contain code on a single line ```C int main() { return 0; } ``` 
end block

trailing text after closing ticks changes the closing block meaning
trailing whitespace after closing ticks does not change a closing block
